In this video, I'm gonna create a Live Username Checker From a JSON File using Vanilla JavaScript, you can use this widget in your registry or sign-up forms or anywhere you want, you can check that username is available to submit or exists in your database, Now I'm using a JSON file as a database and in my next video I will use a real MySQL database and connect this username field with that, also I show you how to create a PHP and MySQL API to checking username field data with the usernames list in your database
